The Common Cold:

"Hello, doctor. Yes, it's me again. They call me the Common Cold. I know, I'm a frequent visitor, but I never
 stay long. I find a nice, warm body, and I just move in for about a week. The first thing I do is make my 
 presence known. I'll make the nose run and the head feel stuffy and heavy, like it's full of cotton. 
 Then, I'll work on the throat, giving it a little tickle that turns into a scratchy, sore feeling. 
 My favorite part is the sneezingâ€”it's how I say hello to everyone else in the room! I make my host feel 
 so tired and achy, like they've run a marathon. But honestly, I'm not trying to cause any real trouble. 
 After seven days or so, I get bored and move on. I'm sure I'll see you again next season."

Type 2 Diabetes

"I suppose you could say I'm a patient who requires a lot of patience. My name is Type 2 Diabetes. 
I don't show up with a bang. I'm quiet. For years, I just hang around in the background. My host might feel a 
little more thirsty than usual or need to use the restroom more often. They might feel tired, but who doesn't 
these days? I just slowly make the body less able to handle sugar. The sweetness they eat starts to linger in 
their blood, unable to get where it needs to go. Over time, my quiet presence becomes louder. Wounds take longer 
to heal, their vision might get a bit blurry, and their feet might start to feel tingly. I'm a slow, creeping 
illness. I change the rules of the body, one spoonful of sugar at a time."

Cancer (Short Version)

    "Doctor, I am Cancer. I'm not an invader; I'm a traitor born from the body's own cells.
    I start when one cell forgets the rules and refuses to stop growing. I build colonies called tumors, stealing 
    energy and making my host weak. My true danger is my ambition to travel, sending seeds through the blood to take 
    root in new organs. I am the body turning on itself."
